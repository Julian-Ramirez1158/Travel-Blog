                <p>
                    This project serves as a basic blog that catalogs all of my recent trips. This web app makes use of the Django framework and consists of a home page in which previews of the blog posts are rendered in succession to the user. 
                    In addition, each preview contains a button that directs the user to a page that renders the full blog post as well as a form to submit a comment. The technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, and Django. 
                    The site can improve by elevating the general styling of the page and integrating user log-in functionality.
